# Snake Game

C# Windows Form Application developed into the famous Snake Game. This game was a challenge and I hit many roadblocks. I watched some youtube to guide me and 
I am getting practice debugging. Probably the most complicated project attempt so far. 

There is an Unhandled Exception on line 25 of the Form1.cs. It is claiming that I am attempting to divide by zero, however I can clearly see in Debug mode and in the Settings class that speed has a setting for 16. Perhaps there is something I am not thinking of in regards to using that variable from another class. Once I get this to work
I believe the game will be be able to run and I will probably add a bit of styling to it from there.
